# Ben's Blog

This is my personal Blog, where I write mostly about Software Development and technology,
as well as other stuff that interests me.
I blog mostly to further elaborate on things I've done and to keep this around as a reminder
(and I hope others might profit from my posts as well). 

Theme used is Kagami (https://github.com/kamikat/jekyll-theme-kagami)
