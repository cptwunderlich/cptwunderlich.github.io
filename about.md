Hi! My name is Ben, I'm a software developer from Vienna (Austria).

This is my personal Blog, where I write mostly about software development and technology,
as well as other stuff that I find interesting.
I blog mostly to further elaborate on things I've done and to keep this around as a reminder
(and I hope others might profit from my posts as well).
